            At the tender age of 4, my dad bought me a My Little Pony record player and two albums: Heart by the artist Heart and Cyndi Lauper, She’s  So Unusual. By age 10 I was playing tenor saxophone and by age 14 I was playing clubs with my all girl band, Mother Mary. While my desire to be in the spotlight has diminished 100 fold, my passion for music has remained constant. In recent years, I found playing drums in musicals, or even playing in bands, monotonous; playing the same set list night after night. Enter DJing- which allows me to take people on a different journey every night, introducing them to someone or something they’ve never heard before. Thanks to a great friend who knew my mindset and dedication towards my craft, I was fortunate enough to have my first gig in 2019 at the Beverly Hilton for a two day event called Abundance 360. I was hooked. I acquired a solid DJ set up and started the super group The Juicy Pair with drummer/boss, Darren (at Dubs Drum Basement). Soon after our second gig, Covid hit like a ton of bricks and  our hopes at South Lake Tahoe residency were crushed. Enter- Twitch. While performing for a computer screen is weird and talking into a microphone more often than I feel comfortable with is awkward, I have found solace and  refuge playing for my new virtual family. I’ve been consistently streaming DJ sets Sunday and Tuesday nights (PST) on Twitch and I recently dialed in my drums with the hopes of doing some drumming streams.

            As a childhood artist, I was infatuated with graffiti. The shading, the colors, and the ability to make sense out of chaos were all very relatable. In my early years I focused solely on lettering (and the occasional skull – my sister was a biker, long story) but as I matured I became super fascinated with realism. Realism is very intimidating, at least to me it was. That is until a random Thursday night in December when I found a 45 minute tutorial, "How to draw a realistic eye," and boom!! Whatdaya know? I guess I have a knack for it.

            I like sports. No, I LOVE sports. I am a jock who plays instruments, we do exist. My greatest love is playing ice hockey with my amazing women's team, 'Bitch?! Please!!' We've traveled together around North America for 20+ years and like a fine wine, we get better with age. By "better" I mean "more fun."
